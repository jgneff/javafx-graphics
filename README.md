# Monocle EPD

This repository is a NetBeans project that contains the JavaFX Graphics module and uses Apache Ant to build its modular JAR file (*javafx.graphics.jar*). I use this project to edit, compile, and test my changes to the [Monocle EPD](https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/339) platform before copying the modified files into my fork of the [official repository](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx).
